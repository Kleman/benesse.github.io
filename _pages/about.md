Hello there! Iâ€™m a French Ph.D. student specialized in Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification and Algorithmic Fairness. You will find on this website some informations about me, may they be academical or not!

If you want to contact me, please send me an email at "firstname.lastname\[youknowwhat\]math.univ-toulouse.fr". I would put the real link in here but, you know, bots and stuff :(
